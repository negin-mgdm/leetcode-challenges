'''
You are working in a ball factory where you have n balls numbered from lowLimit up to highLimit inclusive 
(i.e., n == highLimit - lowLimit + 1), and an infinite number of boxes numbered from 1 to infinity.
Your job at this factory is to put each ball in the box with a number equal to the sum of digits of the ball's number. 
For example, the ball number 321 will be put in the box number 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 and the ball number 10 will be put in the box number 1 + 0 = 1.
Given two integers lowLimit and highLimit, return the number of balls in the box with the most balls.

Example 1:
Input: lowLimit = 1, highLimit = 10
Output: 2
Explanation:
Box Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...
Ball Count:  2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0  0  ...
Box 1 has the most number of balls with 2 balls.

Example 2:
Input: lowLimit = 5, highLimit = 15
Output: 2
Explanation:
Box Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...
Ball Count:  1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 0  0  ...
Boxes 5 and 6 have the most number of balls with 2 balls in each.

Example 3:
Input: lowLimit = 19, highLimit = 28
Output: 2
Explanation:
Box Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ...
Ball Count:  0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2  0  0  ...
Box 10 has the most number of balls with 2 balls.
 
Constraints:
1 <= lowLimit <= highLimit <= 105
